This is my first android project after learning few basics, i did it for my college as java project,
i used android-studio and firebase
i learnt many things, such as constraint layout, recyclerview, async task . and A bit of new android architechture

I'm still learning, I'm still trying to improve codes and layouts,it's made of firebase database, so next,i also want implement restapi,i want to use services, so it will have option to share with other app. i want to implement push notification too
